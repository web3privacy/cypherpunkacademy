# "Turn degens into Cypherpunk" course

## goals
- focus on knowledge creation (follow existing courses framework)
- focus on micro-learning (max 4 hours per module, 10-20 minutes per new knowledge)
- focus on the intro module instead of the whole course
- find out the right edge on how to turn Degens into Cypherpunks: should we focus on the positive side of the culture? Friendship aka community? Memes? etc

## Contribute
1. Analyze how Coursera structures learning courses - focus on courses-specific course-modules-learning formats-hours on completion.
2. Contribute to Cypherpunk appropriation: learn from existing courses, steal working methods, adapt to Cypherpunk learning curve.
3. Structure proposed takes.
- make bigger ideas actionable (how many hours are needed to complete the course, module, one lecture?)
- apply micro-learning concept (1 knowledge/idea/skill x 5-10 min of attention): discover here
4. Focus only on the 1st course - better deliver something than work on the neverending "100 best of the best academy".
